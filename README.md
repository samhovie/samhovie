### Hi, I'm Sam!

Iâ€™m a software developer and aspiring audio engineer. Experiencing my own and others creations never gets old for me, and drives my continuous improvement. Iâ€™m constantly diving deeper into my interests, and when I surprise myself with what I come up with itâ€™s a never-ending feedback loop.


<!-- 
Through experience in class, freelance, and side projects, Iâ€™ve worked with a number of technologies. On the frontend, Iâ€™ve used Javascript, including React and Redux frameworks to build intuitive interfaces. On the other side of the stack, Iâ€™ve leveraged Python with frameworks such as Flask as well as Express.js to build rich backends. I also have solid knowledge of databases, having taken database management systems as part of my undergrad, and working with SQL and object relational models during my bootcamp. Lately, Iâ€™m working on training a music ai with a large distributed data set.
