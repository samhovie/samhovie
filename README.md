### Hi, I'm Sam!

Iâ€™m a frontend developer, musician, and aspiring audio engineer. Experiencing my own creations never gets old for me, and it drives my continuous improvement. Iâ€™m constantly diving deeper into what interests me, and when I surprise myself with what I come up with itâ€™s a never-ending feedback loop. Expressing myself is important to me, and learning new things gives me more to show. I spend my free time playing music with my friends, tinkering with a side project, or doing something active outside.

Iâ€™ve always appreciated creativity, but I never thought it could be used to more directly make an impact. That is, until I found coding. I was hooked from the first if statement. I realized that small building blocks meant seemingly infinite flexibility in implementation, and I was all in. After taking the introductory programming courses but now late in my schooling, I managed to take one upper level computer science course as part of my major in cognitive science. After college, I freelanced for a while, but soon decided I need more direction on frontend technologies. A bootcamp seemed like a good fit, and allowed me to dig in to some well known stacks and learn a more replicable approach to building applications. After gaining comfort in my skills, frontend design has been my favorite thing to do, and I see it as a huge responsibility to be the first point of contact with the user.
